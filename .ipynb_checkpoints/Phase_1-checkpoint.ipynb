    "\n",
    "YouTube is one of the leading video sharing and social media platform in the world. Thus, It had a huge impact on changing the marketing startegies by video promotion or sponsoring independent Youtubers, with its captivating features such as the recommendation page, and trending page. However, the later doesn’t have a clear indication of what makes a Youtube video trending. Hence, the speculation on what makes a video trending such as [Researching The Trending Tab (BTS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEvtpj-uChA&ab_channel=Coffeezilla), [What Is YouTube Trending And How It Works](https://www.notion.so/project-scooping-427deb3f9cbc4c32949c17248bdc0a30#04a09cb6fee248398f38d2fa43a72052). The goal of the project is to perform EDA analysis on the dataset to find the patterns among trending videos and develop a classification model to attribute the factor that affects how popular a Youtube video will be. Those insights might be used by Youtube channels owned by tradational companies that seek to break into the new marketing field, or they can be used by individual Youtubers that seek to increase the popularity of their videos, without effecting their content creation. This project will relay on [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset) from Kaggle which was collected using the Youtube API.\n",
